# FullOn Blockchain Due-Diligence Checklist

Layer-1 Blockchain 

This checklist is designed for investor-side scrutiny of a Layer-1 blockchain hosting RWA
applications such as Ink Finance, without embedding RWA economics into the native token.

## Governance & Protocol Evolution

    inclusion?
  - **Answer**:
  
## Consensus Mechanism

- Specify the consensus algorithm (PoS, DPoS, BFT hybrid, etc.).
  - **Answer**: 

- What are the security assumptions (slashing rules, finality guarantees, honest-majority thresholds)?
  - **Answer**:

- Validator requirements — minimum stake, hardware specs, uptime penalties.
  - **Answer**:

  - **Answer**:

  - **Answer**: 

## Blockchain Trilemma Evaluation

- Is validator set open and proportionally decentralized?
  - **Answer**:
  
- What is total staked value vs. circulating supply?
  - **Answer**:
  
- Average TPS, block time, gas cost, finality latency.
  - **Answer**:
  
- How does the team justify its position on the trilemma spectrum?
  - **Answer**:
  
## Technical Maturity

- Is the codebase public with verifiable GitHub commits and contributions?
  - **Answer**:
  
- Duration of mainnet uptime and history of incidents.
  - **Answer**: 

- Have multiple security audits been conducted and disclosed?
  - **Answer**:
  
- Does the network have bug-bounty or incident-response programs?
  - **Answer**:

- Assess ease of node operation — documentation, tooling, community support.
  - **Answer**:
  
## Ecosystem & Developer Readiness

- Evaluate developer tools (SDKs, APIs, explorer, documentation quality).
  - **Answer**:
  
- Confirm EVM wrapper stability and performance benchmarks.
  - **Answer**:
  
- Inventory of existing dApps — are they producing real usage?
  - **Answer**:
  
- Availability of bridges or interoperability layers with major ecosystems.
  - **Answer**:
  
- List of oracles, indexers, custodians, or other infra partners.
  - **Answer**:
  
- Review developer incentive programs, hackathons, or grant mechanisms.

## User Adoption & Market Positioning

- Number of active wallets and transactions (DAU/MAU trend).
  - **Answer**:
  
- Geographic distribution of user base and validator nodes.
  - **Answer**:
  
- Clarity of target audience (music IP players vs. general Web3 users).
  - **Answer**:
  
- Quality of community engagement — Discord, GitHub, social channels.
  - **Answer**:
  
- Marketing narrative and differentiation vs. competitors (Audius, Opus, etc.).

## Go-to-Market & Partnerships

- Identify strategic partnerships with labels, publishers, or tech providers.
  - **Answer**:
  
- What is the BD and ecosystem fund structure (size, governance, deployment speed)?
  - **Answer**:
  
- Presence of regional operating entities (HK, SG, US) for regulatory interface.
  - **Answer**:
  
- Track record of media coverage and narrative control.
  - **Answer**:
  
- Evaluate alignment between GTM strategy and institutional adoption goals.
  - **Answer**:

## Tokenomics & Indirect Value Capture

- Are all transactions payable exclusively in the native token?
  - **Answer**:
  
- Is there a fee-burn mechanism, and what share of fees are burned vs. recycled?
  - **Answer**:
  
- How are gas revenues distributed among validators and treasury?
  - **Answer**:
  
- What safeguards exist if network usage declines — does the fee model remain sustainable?
  - **Answer**:

- What is the total stake ratio and minimum stake per validator?
  - **Answer**:
  
- How are staking rewards funded (inflation, fees, or both)?
  - **Answer**:
  
- Does token inflation exceed organic demand growth, causing dilution?
  - **Answer**:
  
- How decentralized is validator ownership and what are slashing parameters?
  - **Answer**: 

- How is the network treasury capitalized (emissions, penalties, redistributions)?
  - **Answer**:

- Who controls treasury disbursement, and is it governed transparently?
  - **Answer**:

- What share of treasury funds supports ecosystem growth, in native tokens?
  - **Answer**:
  
- Is there evidence of active treasury investment that stimulates usage?
- How are blockspace prices determined — algorithmically or fixed?
- Does the chain maintain a fee-market equilibrium under varying demand?
- How is blockspace demand growth measured and communicated as a value driver?
- What governance rights attach to the token (protocol changes, treasury votes)?
- How broad or concentrated is historical voter participation?
- Does governance influence economic parameters affecting application ecosystems?
- Is there evidence governance rights create token demand beyond speculation?
- Can validators extract MEV, and how is that value captured or redistributed?
- Are there MEV auctions or PBS frameworks returning value to token holders?
- What portion of validator yield originates from non-inflationary sources?
- Does the chain support persistent on-chain storage or metadata registries?
- Are there recurring storage fees payable in native tokens?
- Do these create a meaningful token sink as network data grows?
- Does association with institutional applications enhance token credibility?
- Has governance over the chain been perceived as strategically valuable due to RWAs?
- How is the team managing regulatory narrative to avoid security-token risks?
- What are long-term demand drivers if usage plateaus?
- Does the team model token velocity and burn-rate scenarios for equilibrium?
- Are there stabilization mechanisms (buy-backs, adaptive yields) for low-activity
    periods?

## Financial & Institutional Health

- Overview of funding history, investors, and terms.
- Current treasury holdings and runway estimate.
- Transparency of financial disclosures or dashboards.
- Realistic revenue or cost projections for validator and ecosystem sustainability.

## Risk & Red-Flag Review

- Excessive validator or treasury centralization.
- Inflationary or speculative tokenomics with weak demand.
- Absence of transparent audit history.
- Regulatory or jurisdictional conflicts with RWA hosting.
- Inactive or shrinking developer community.
- Governance capture by foundation insiders.
- Lack of sustainable value capture beyond speculation.
