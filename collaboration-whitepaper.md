# FullOn Public Chain Ecosystem Strategic Cooperation White Paper

## Version Information

- **Version**: 1.0

- **Release Date**: November 2025

- **Issuing Organization**: FullOn Public Chain Foundation

- **Scope of Application**: FullOn Public Chain and its ecosystem strategic cooperation projects

## Introduction As a high-performance, decentralized Layer 1 public chain, FullOn Public Chain is committed to building an open and interconnected Web3 ecosystem. Through strategic cooperation with high-quality ecosystem projects, FullOn Public Chain will achieve exponential growth in user scale, transaction depth, and capital flow. This white paper defines the selection criteria, empowerment mechanism, and incentive system for ecosystem strategic cooperation, aiming to form an ecological closed loop of "symbiosis, co-construction, and sharing."

By meeting the selection criteria, ecosystem project participants will receive comprehensive empowerment from FullOn Public Chain in terms of technology, traffic, funding, and governance; simultaneously, by contributing users, funds, and technology, they will receive long-term incentives in the FLON base token, achieving a two-way value binding.

## I. FullOn Public Chain Foundation Selection Criteria

To ensure the high quality and sustainability of ecosystem strategic cooperation, the FullOn Public Chain Foundation has established the following **hard entry requirements**:

| No. | Requirement | Specific Criteria |

|------|----------|----------|

| 1 | Possess a Platform Token | ≥80% of the total issuance of the platform token has been cross-chained or natively issued to the FullOn public chain |

| 2 | Core Application On-Chain | Core business logic (such as payment, social, DeFi, GameFi, etc.) is built based on FullOn public chain technology |

| 3 | Built-in RWID Wallet | The project APP integrates FullOn's unique **RWID (Real-World ID) wallet generation technology**, supporting one-click creation of on-chain accounts |

| 4 | Scale of Contribution | Expected to be imported into the FullOn ecosystem:<br>• On-chain users ≥ **100,000**<br>• Daily transaction volume ≥ **10 million USD**<br>• On-chain funds ≥ **5 million USD** |

| 5 | Existing user base | The project already has ≥ **10,000** active users, with rapid migration capabilities |

> **Note**: Only projects meeting all 5 criteria can enter the foundation's review process. The review period will not exceed 14 business days.

## II. FullOn Public Chain's Empowerment System for the Ecosystem Project

Through strategic partnerships, ecosystem projects will receive the following **seven core empowerments**:

### 1. FLON Incentive Pool (Total 1.8 billion FLON, representing 18% of the total supply)

- Dedicated to rewarding all strategic ecosystem partner projects

- Dynamically allocated based on contribution until all 1.8 billion FLON are released

- Release rules: **4-year linear unlocking (T+48 months)**

### 2. RWID Wallet Technology Licensing

- Provides **RWID Wallet SDK**, supporting project teams to generate FullOn on-chain accounts with a single click within their apps

- Supports **channel number binding**: When users register their wallets, the project team's designated account is written into the on-chain metadata as the basis for subsequent incentive allocation

- Technical support: Provides complete API documentation, testnet environment, and security audits

### 3. Token Issuance and DEX Integration

- Provides **native token issuance services** (FullOn chain or other EVM-compatible chains)

- Connects to FullOn ecosystem DEXs (decentralized exchanges)

- Equipped with **Automated Market Making Bot (AMM + Market Maker Bot)** to ensure deep liquidity

### 4. Cross-chain Asset Bridging

- Supports bidirectional atomic cross-chain transfers between mainstream assets such as **USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH** and the FullOn public chain

- Ensures asset security and instant settlement

### 5. Ecosystem User Interconnectivity

- Access to the **FullOn ecosystem user pool**, enabling cross-project user sharing and joint marketing

- Supports **on-chain identity tokens (Soulbound Tokens)**, enabling users to inherit cross-project rights

### 6. Decentralized Social Services

- Provides the **FullOn Social Protocol**, supporting the construction of decentralized social feeds within projects

- Users can publish content on the FullOn chain for cross-project dissemination

### 7. AI Technology Module Integration

- Open **FullOn AI Agents**, supporting:

- On-chain AI inference (text generation, image recognition)

- Intelligent recommendation engine

- Anti-fraud risk control model

- Automated trading

## III. Paths for Ecosystem Projects to Obtain FLON Incentives

Ecosystem projects obtain FLON incentives through the following **three methods**, all of which are **released linearly over 4 years**.

### Path 1: Value Injection Incentive (Core Path)

| Contribution Type | Incentive Standard | Release Rules |

|--------|----------|----------|

| **1.1 Wallet Registration Users** | • Reward of **100 FLON** per **valid user**<br>• Or choose **low incentive mode**: **10 FLON** per user<br>• Definition of valid user: Completes KYC or on-chain interactions ≥ 20 times |

| **1.2 Fund Inflow** | Reward of **0.001 USD equivalent FLON** per **1 USD** (USDT/USDC) inflow<br> (calculated based on the average FLON/USD price of the week) | 4-year linear release |

> **Calculation Example**:

> Project imports 100,000 valid users + 5 million USD funds

→ Incentive = 100,000 × 100 FLON + 5 million × 0.001 × FLON price

> → Total incentives will be credited linearly over 4 years

### Path Two: Token Swap (Optional, negotiated by both parties)

| Project | Content |

|------|------|

| **2.1 Lock-up Method** | After an equal-value token swap between the two parties, tokens will be locked up uniformly through the FullOn chain smart contract.

| **2.2 Exchange Ratio** | Calculated at the equivalent value of the **private placement price** of both parties.

| **2.3 Release Plan** | Default **18-month lock-up period + subsequent 4-year linear release**.

> **Example**:

> Project A private placement price: 0.1 USD, Project B (FullOn) private placement price: 0.05 USD

> → Swap 10 million A tokens ↔ 20 million FLON, locked in the smart contract

### Path Three: Become a Core Validator Node

| Benefits | Content |

|------|------|

| **3.1 Eligibility** | Strategic Cooperation Project **Preset to obtain 21 core node election qualifications** |

| **3.2 Node Rewards** | After deploying a node, participate in:<br> • Network consensus maintenance<br> • Block packaging<br> • **Node mining reward (FLON)** |

> Node rewards are independent of ecosystem incentives and are not limited by the 1.8 billion pool

## V. Risk Warning and Exit Mechanism

1. **Incentive Recovery**: If a project party engages in fraud, absconds, or commits serious violations during the cooperation period, the Foundation reserves the right to recover the released FLON.

2. **Exit Mechanism**: Either party may withdraw by giving 30 days' written notice. Any remaining unreleased FLON will automatically become invalid.

3. **Transparent Audit**: All incentive data is on-chain and verifiable, subject to community oversight.
