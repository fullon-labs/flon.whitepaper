**Token features:** The native digital cryptographically-secured utility token of the **FullOn** Platform (**$FLON** token) is a transferable representation of attributed functions specified in the protocol/code of the **FullOn** Platform, designed to play a major role in the functioning of the ecosystem on the **FullOn** Platform, and intended to be used solely as the primary utility token on the platform. **$FLON** token is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants on the **FullOn** Platform. The goal of introducing **$FLON** token is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the **FullOn** Platform, and it is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public (or a section of the public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; nor is it designed or intended to be used by any person as payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not exclusively provided by the issuer. **$FLON** token does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Foundation, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will **$FLON** token entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Switzerland, Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. **$FLON** token may only be utilised on the **FullOn** Platform, and ownership of **$FLON** token carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use **$FLON** token as a means to enable usage of and interaction within the **FullOn** Platform.

The **$FLON** token enables the economic coordination of all participants who operate the network plus it enables new behaviors among the applications which are built on top of that network, by providing the economic incentives which will be consumed to encourage participants to contribute and maintain the ecosystem on the **FullOn** Platform. As a decentralized network the **FullOn** Platform relies on various participants to provide resources for network maintenance, and so **$FLON** token will be used as the medium of exchange to quantify and pay the costs of the consumed resources. **$FLON** token is an integral and indispensable part of the **FullOn** Platform, because without **$FLON** token, there would be no incentive for users to expend resources to participate in activities or provide services for the benefit of the entire ecosystem on the **FullOn** Platform. Users of the **FullOn** Platform and/or holders of **$FLON** token which did not actively participate will not receive any **$FLON** token incentives.

**$FLON** token would have the following features:

  1. pay within the ecosystem for various services, such as processing transactions, providing bandwidth, and storing data;
  1. run a validating node (providing computational resources to validate information / produce blocks) as part of the network by participating in the staking process; and
  1. help determine how network resources are allocated and where its future technical direction will go by participating in governance processes (for the avoidance of doubt, the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of the **FullOn** Platform; the right to vote does not entitle **$FLON** token holders to vote on the operation and management of the Foundation, the Distributor or their respective affiliates, or their assets, and does not constitute any equity interest in any of the aforementioned entities).

Disclaimers relating to the **$FLON** token: It is expressly highlighted that **$FLON** token:

  1. does not have any tangible or physical manifestation, and does not have any intrinsic value (nor does any person make any representation or give any commitment as to its value);
  1. is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other virtual currency) or any payment obligation by the Foundation, the Distributor or any of their respective affiliates;
  1. does not represent or confer on the token holder any right of any form with respect to the Foundation, the Distributor (or any of their respective affiliates), or its revenues or assets, including without limitation any right to receive future dividends, revenue, shares, ownership right or stake, share or security, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property or licence rights), right to receive accounts, financial statements or other financial data, the right to requisition or participate in shareholder meetings, the right to nominate a director, or other financial or legal rights or equivalent rights, or intellectual property rights or any other form of participation in or relating to the **FullOn** Platform, the Foundation, the Distributor and/or their service providers;
  1. is not intended to represent any rights under a contract for differences or under any other contract the purpose or pretended purpose of which is to secure a profit or avoid a loss;
  1. is not intended to be a representation of money (including electronic money), security, commodity, bond, debt instrument, unit in a collective investment scheme or any other kind of financial instrument or investment;
